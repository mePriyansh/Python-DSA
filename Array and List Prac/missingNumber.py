'''Write a function to find the missing number in a given integer array of 1 to 100.
The function takes to parameter the array and the number of elements that needs to be in array.  
For example if we want to find missing number from 1 to 6 the second parameter will be 6.

Example:
missing_number([1, 2, 3, 4, 6], 6)'''

def missing_number(arr, n):
    # Calculate the sum of first n natural numbers
    total = n * (n + 1) // 2
    
    # Calculate the sum of numbers in the array
    sum_arr = sum(arr)
    
    # Find the missing number by subtracting sum_arr from total
    missing = total - sum_arr
    
    return missing

print(missing_number([1, 2, 3, 4, 6], 6))
